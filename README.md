# SimpleInterpreter_Rust
Created an interpreter for the Asa compiler, which runs code written in the Rust language. It takes the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) generated by the compiler and executes them. The interpreter handles different types of nodes, such as expressions and function calls, to perform the actions described by the code. This makes it possible to execute programs by turning their abstract representations into actual results. 

This project demonstrates the entire process of transforming source code into executable results. It starts by tokenizing the source code, then passes these tokens through a parser that structures the code into a tree-like format (AST). Finally, an interpreter takes this structured data and executes it, turning the original source code into actual results. This workflow showcases how code can be broken down, understood, and run step by step.

## Required Features

The following functionality is implemented:

- [X] Implemented the ability to insert elements, such as variables, functions, and expressions, into the AST during the parsing phase, enabling their evaluation and execution.
- [X] Developed a lexer to tokenize the input source code into a sequence of tokens representing language constructs like keywords, identifiers, numbers, and symbols.
- [X] Implemented a parser that constructs an AST from the token sequence, providing a hierarchical representation of the programâ€™s structure for further processing.
- [X] Enabled parsing of various expressions, including mathematical operations, boolean values, function calls, and variable definitions, for integration into the AST.
- [X] Supported parsing and execution of basic arithmetic operations (addition and subtraction) and boolean logic within the language.
- [X] Implemented functionality to parse and manage string literals, allowing for string manipulation within the language.
- [X] Enabled recognition and insertion of function definitions and calls into the AST, supporting modular code through user-defined functions.
- [X] Developed an interpreter to traverse the AST and execute the parsed program, producing results or modifying the program state based on the inserted logic.

## How to run

1. Run "cargo build" to compile the project
2. Run "cargo test" to check the passing test cases
3. Run "cargo run" to actually run the project. In this case, this is not very important as main.rs only includes one "test case". Therefore, running "cargo test" is to verify the interpreter is working with our many test case inputs.
4. Enjoy the project!
